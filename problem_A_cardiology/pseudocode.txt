First, try to replicate the original magic problem with a function - given a number of rows and columns and some hard-coded values.

Define constants of `maxIterations = 3` & `nthColumnPicked = 2` 


Given 7 rows and 3 columns & a number picked by spectator (4): 
- create a nested array (array[7][3])
- Iterate through cards 
-
