INPUT: provide rows and columns

Steps:
2. lay out all the cards given # of rows and columns
3. choose any card (could have the computer randomly assign a card to `chosenCard`?)
4. determine the column that the card is in
5. determine which order to pick up columns --> NEED HELP HERE
6. pick and re-deal cards `n` times, 
        such that cards end up in the same middle-most spot twice


functions to:
-- pick random card
-- created nested array given # of rows and columns
-- given chosenCard and nested array, return the card's starting location

iterate through picking up card's column 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc (input)
    given a column order in which to be picked up and starting location,
        iterate through picking up & redealing (function) - return new location
            until location is the same twice in a row, returning # of iterations AND location (row, column)
