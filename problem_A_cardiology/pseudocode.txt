INPUT: provide rows and columns

Steps:
2. lay out all the cards given # of rows and columns
3. choose any card (could have the computer randomly assign a card to `chosenCard`?)
4. determine the column that the card is in
5. determine which order to pick up columns --> NEED HELP HERE
6. pick and re-deal cards `n` times, 
        such that cards end up in the same middle-most spot twice


functions to:
- find location
- find iterations needed for that location
- find nth column needed to be picked up
